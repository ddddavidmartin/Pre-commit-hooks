Check INSTALL for documentation on how to install and use these hooks.

   readlink -f with non GNU versions of readlink. Required for example  for the
   hooks to run on Mac OS.

    Copy hooks over to your local git repository.

pre-commit:
    Allow to run multiple pre-commit hooks as specified in the script.

pre-commit-compile:
    Compile the project and abort commit if it fails.

pre-commit-default:
    The default git pre-commit hook checking for example for trailing
    whitespaces.

pre-commit-uncrustify:

    command to apply it.
