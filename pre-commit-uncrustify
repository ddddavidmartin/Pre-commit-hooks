# git pre-commit hook that runs an Uncrustify stylecheck.
# Features:
#  - abort commit when commit does not comply with the style guidelines
#  - create a patch of the proposed style changes
#
# More info on Uncrustify: http://uncrustify.sourceforge.net/

# This file is part of a set of unofficial pre-commit hooks available
# at github.
